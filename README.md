# Hola, soy Andres Alvarez 👋
### I am a software engineer passionate about innovation, startups and artificial intelligence. I started programming at the age of 14 and I've been creating software since I was 19 years old. I have more than 3 years working entirely within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, as a worker and also as a founder. I have led agile development teams and mentored other developers. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Artificial Intelligence
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on an interesting project
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Blockchain and... philosophy why not?
- ⚡ Fun fact: Python is older than Java 🐍
