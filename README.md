### I started to program at 14 when i wanted to hack into the computers of the laboratory of computation of my school (I didn't 💔). My first language was Python (and still love it), I'm a snake charmer. In the last year, I started to learn about Artifical Intelligence and made some cool stuff with it. Currently I'm studying Backend Development and Data Science. I love the projects that break paradigms and help the society.
