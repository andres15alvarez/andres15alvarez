### I am a software engineer passionate about innovation, startups and artificial intelligence. I started programming at the age of 14 and I've been creating software since I was 19 years old. I have more than 3 years working entirely within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, as a worker and also as a founder. I have led agile development teams and mentored other developers.
